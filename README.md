# quiz-zing
An online version of Nazarene Youth Bible Quizzing's Quiz Machine.

Current TODO list (1-6-22):
 - Cleanup/debug/finalize the lineups menu.
 - Create the "jump" dialog for when a quizzer jumps.
	- Add event listeners to the buttons to make the quizzers jump when clicked on.
	- Based on how a quizzer answers, change the individual and team score, checking for quiz/error outs, etc.
	- Increment the question number.
 - Create other menus (timeouts, challenges, etc).
 - Longterm: get timer to work, keep track of stats, connect to actual hardware.
